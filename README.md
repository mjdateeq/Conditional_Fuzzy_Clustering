This algorithm was introduced by Dr. Witold Pedrycz in:
W. Pedrycz, "Conditional Fuzzy C-Means", Pattern Recognition Letters, vol. 17, n. 6, pp. 625-631, May 1996.

it has been used in some papers such as the following
W. Pedrycz, "Conditional Fuzzy Clustering in the Design of Radial Basis Function Neural Networks", IEEE Trans. on Neural Network, vol. 9, n.4, pp. 601-612, July 1998.
